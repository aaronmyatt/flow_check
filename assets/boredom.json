  "text": "$name has indicated that, relative to their perceived skill level, they are being under-challenged. This can lead a person to feel underutilised and generally bored. $name may need a new challenge, more responsibility, or both! Work with $name to identify what triggers their motivation best, be it a deeply technical project, leading or mentoring newbies, or researching a new frontier for the company.\n\nIt is also reasonable that someone who feels burned out may associate that sensation, a lack of motivation to contribute at work, with boredom. Take the opportunity during 1-on-1s to double confirm that $name has not been stuck in the same routine, the same responsibilities for too long. If so, look to diversify their backlog with some new experiences to shake them out of the monotony.\n"
