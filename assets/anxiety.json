  "text": "$name could be feeling overwhelmed with things right now. $name is suggesting that the challenge they are experiencing is far outweighing the skill they have. In some cases, it is meaningful to have someone step outside of their comfort zone, be cautious to determine if this is one of those. Did $name ask for something challenging? Or was it laid at their feet unfairly? Be sure to throw as much support $nameâ€™s way as is within your power to do so, encourage $name to raise the alarm earlier in the future.\n\nFortunately, with some help and planning, $name can be helped to manage this situation, and with a little alleviation, reduce the size of the challenge before them, and help course-correct back into Flow!\n"
